# hsrAutoContinueBattle
Auto continue battles (One More Time) in Honkai: Star Rail

# How it works
It will locate the (One More Time) Button every 5 seconds and will relocate the mouse pointer and click on its own. It does not interact with the game files  in any way.

# Usage
Run `setup.bat` as an Administrator, restart your PC and you're good to go! It should run everytime Honkai: Star Rail is opened and the game should now auto continue battle  

If it does not continue the battle 5 seconds after it has ended, it would mean the script is not being started correctly, in which case you have to run the executable manually everytime you play HSR.  
Navigate to where `main.exe` is and run it as Administrator and you're good to go!
